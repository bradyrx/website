  abstract={The physical circulation of the Southern Ocean sets the surface concentration and thus air-sea exchange of CO2. However, we have a limited understanding of the three-dimensional circulation that brings deep carbon-rich waters to the surface. Here, we introduce and analyze a novel high-resolution ocean model simulation with active biogeochemistry and online Lagrangian particle tracking. We focus our attention on a subset of particles with high dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) that originate below 1,000 m and eventually upwell into the near-surface layer (upper 200 m). We find that 71% of the DIC-enriched water upwelling across 1,000 m is concentrated near topographic features, which occupy just 33% of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Once particles upwell to the near-surface layer, they exhibit relatively uniform pCO2 levels and DIC decorrelation timescales, regardless of their origin. Our results show that Southern Ocean bathymetry plays a key role in delivering carbon-rich waters to the surface.},

  author={Brady, Riley X and Lovenduski, Nicole S and Yeager, Stephen G and Long, Matthew C and Lindsay, Keith},
  year={2020},
  journal={Nature Communications},
  abstract={The California Current System (CCS) sustains economically valuable fisheries and is particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification, due to its natural upwelling of carbon-enriched waters that generate corrosive conditions for local ecosystems. Here we use a novel suite of retrospective, initialized ensemble forecasts with an Earth system model (ESM) to predict the evolution of surface pH anomalies in the CCS. We show that the forecast system skillfully predicts observed surface pH variations a year in advance over a naive forecasting method, with the potential for skillful prediction up to five years in advance. Skillful predictions of surface pH are mainly derived from the initialization of dissolved inorganic carbon anomalies that are subsequently transported into the CCS. Our results demonstrate the potential for ESMs to provide skillful predictions of ocean acidification on large scales in the CCS. Initialized ESMs could also provide boundary conditions to improve high-resolution regional forecasting systems.},

  title={Finding the fingerprint of anthropogenic climate change in marine phytoplankton abundance},
  author={Elsworth, Geneviève W and Lovenduski, Nicole S and McKinnon, Karon A and Krumhardt, Kristen M and Brady, Riley X},
  year={2020},
  journal={Current Climate Change Reports},
  abstract={<i>Purpose of review</i>: We review how phytoplankton abundance may be responding to the increase in stratification associated with anthropogenic climate change, providing context on the utility of remote sensing datasets and Earth system model output to understand these perturbations.<br><br>
<i>Recent findings</i>: Assessing disruption in the ocean biosphere using remote sensing datasets is challenged by the relatively short length of the observational record, restricting our ability to disentangle fluctuations due to internal climate variability from those imposed by externally forced anthropogenic trends. Ensembles of Earth system models can be used to quantify past and future drivers, but may not skillfully predict observed spatial patterns and temporal dynamics in marine phytoplankton.<br><br>
<i>Summary</i>: To better understand the role of internal climate variability in the observational record, we construct a synthetic ensemble of global chlorophyll concentration over the MODIS satellite mission using statistical emulation techniques. We emphasize the use of a synthetic ensemble to illuminate the role of internal climate variability in the evolution of the ocean biosphere over time.

  author={Dutta, Soumya and Brady, Riley X and Maltrud, Mathew E and Wolfram, Phillip J and Bujack, Roxana B},
  year={2019},
  booktitle={Visualization in Environmental Sciences (EnvirVis)},
  abstract = {Understanding the origins of nutrients, e.g., nitrate, in ocean water is essential to develop an effective mariculture technique forfree-floating macroalgae, which presents a potential solution to provide an alternative source of domestic renewable fuels to helpreduce carbon emissions from automobiles. To study this problem, scientists simulate large-scale computational simulationswith coupled flow and nutrient information. Since running the simulation multiple times is expensive, the scientists want tohave efficient visual-analytic techniques that can analyze and visualize the simulation output quickly to investigate the reasonsbehind the existence of nitrate in different areas of ocean water. To address these needs, a mixed Lagrangian and Eulerian-based analysis technique is developed that leverages traditional Lagrangian analysis methods and fuses Eulerian informationwith it to comprehend the origins of nutrients in the water. The proposed method yielded promising results for the applicationscientists and positive feedback from them demonstrates the efficacy of the technique.},

  title={On the role of climate modes in modulating the air--sea CO2 fluxes in {Eastern} {Boundary} {Upwelling} {Systems}},
  author={Brady, Riley X and Lovenduski, Nicole S and Alexander, Michael A and Jacox, Michael and Gruber, Nicolas},
  journal={Biogeosciences},
  abstract = {The air–sea CO2 fluxes in eastern boundary upwelling systems (EBUSs) vary strongly in time and space, with some of the highest flux densities globally. The processes controlling this variability have not yet been investigated consistently across all four major EBUSs, i.e., the California (CalCS), Humboldt (HumCS), Canary (CanCS), and Benguela (BenCS) Current systems. In this study, we diagnose the climatic modes of the air–sea CO2 flux variability in these regions between 1920 and 2015, using simulation results from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LENS), a global coupled climate model ensemble that is forced by historical and RCP8.5 radiative forcing. Differences between simulations can be attributed entirely to internal (unforced) climate variability, whose contribution can be diagnosed by subtracting the ensemble mean from each simulation. We find that in the CalCS and CanCS, the resulting anomalous CO2 fluxes are strongly affected by large-scale extratropical modes of variability, i.e., the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), respectively. The CalCS has anomalous uptake of CO2 during the positive phase of the NPGO, while the CanCS has anomalous outgassing of CO2 during the positive phase of the NAO. In contrast, the HumCS is mainly affected by El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), with anomalous uptake of CO2 during an El Niño event. Variations in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and sea surface temperature (SST) are the major contributors to these anomalous CO2 fluxes and are generally driven by changes to large-scale gyre circulation, upwelling, the mixed layer depth, and biological processes. A better understanding of the sensitivity of EBUS CO2 fluxes to modes of climate variability is key in improving our ability to predict the future evolution of the atmospheric CO2 source and sink characteristics of the four EBUSs.},

  title={Emergent anthropogenic trends in California Current upwelling},
  author={Brady, Riley X and Alexander, Michael A and Lovenduski, Nicole S and Rykaczewski, Ryan R},
  journal={Geophysical Research Letters},
  abstract = {Upwelling in the California Current System (CCS) sustains a productive ecosystem and is mediated by alongshore, equatorward wind stress. A decades‐old hypothesis proposes that global warming will accelerate these upwelling favorable winds. Recent analyses provide empirical support for upwelling intensification in the poleward portion of the CCS. However, these studies rely on proxies for upwelling and are limited in their ability to distinguish anthropogenic forcing from internal climate variability. Here we estimate simulated changes in CCS upwelling from 1920 to 2100 using monthly output from a single climate model ensemble, where divergences among simulations can be attributed entirely to internal climate variability. Our projections suggest that CCS upwelling will become more intense in the spring and less intense in the summer as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Anthropogenic changes in upwelling will emerge primarily in the second half of the century.},
