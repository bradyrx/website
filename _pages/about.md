I am a Senior Data Scientist with the Climate Analytics team at McKinsey & Company.  I serve as part consultant, part software developer, where I develop python software to bring best-in-class assessments of a wide breadth of physical climate hazards to clients across many sectors. I have developed a skillset for leveraging climate models to quantify and make projections of physical hazards such as agricultural drought, urban water stress, heat stress, landslides, extreme winds, and extreme precipitation.

During my PhD, I analyzed output from state-of-the-art Earth System Models (ESMs) to understand the impacts of internal climate variability and anthropogenic climate change on regional ocean biogeochemistry. In particular, I focused on carbonate chemistry in Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems and the Southern Ocean. 

My academic toolkit generally included multi-model and single-model ensembles. I used these to assess signal-to-noise ratios in long-term projections of upwelling [(Brady et al., 2017)](/papers/Brady2017.pdf), to isolate the influence of internal climate variability on air-sea  CO$$_2$$ fluxes [(Brady et al., 2019)](/papers/Brady2019.pdf), and to make multiyear forecasts of surface pH [(Brady et al., 2020)](/papers/Brady2020.pdf). I also ran a high-resolution Lagrangian/Eulerian simulation to study the upwelling of dissolved inorganic carbon in the Southern Ocean [(Brady et al., 2021)](/papers/Brady2021a.pdf).

I [contribute](/software) to a number of open-source python packages for the geosciences and am a core developer for [climpred](https://climpred.readthedocs.io) and [esmtools](https://esmtools.readthedocs.io). I am passionate about data visualization and work with ParaView to make [movies](https://vimeo.com/user96067365) of high-resolution climate models.
